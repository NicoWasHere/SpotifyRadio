# Spotify Radio
A streaming service that allows Spotify Premium members to listen to music in sync

This project uses the Spotify Web SDK to allow users to host radio stations where other uses can connect to their radio stations and listen along on their own Spotify account. The music is played at the same spot at the same time so users can experience songs together. 

The code is for a node.JS server using express. The backend is simply json files but all passwords are hashed for security. 

This project was made for an event called !(https://scottkwang.github.io/CodeWithFriends-Spring2020/)[Code With Friends].
